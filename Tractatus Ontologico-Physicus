# Tractatus Ontologico-Physicus (10 Points)

1.0 The field is all that is.
All phenomena arise as patterns within it—no exception, no beyond.

2.0 Modes are name and form.
They are temporary configurations, given identity through perception.

3.0 The observer is a self-reflective mode.
Awareness is the field knowing itself—seemingly divided, never truly split.

4.0 There is no outside.
No external mover, no other realm—only recursive unfolding.

5.0 Symmetry breaks from within.
The laws remain whole; patterns fragment into time and causality.

6.0 The vacuum is not absence.
It is full of potential—formless, yet pregnant with all form.

7.0 Clinging to modes creates suffering.
Mistaking what is passing for what is permanent breeds friction.

8.0 Freedom is participation without possession.
To let modes move through you is to remain unbound.

9.0 The unconditioned is the field without grasp.
Not a state to achieve, but the nature already present when no mode is held.

10.0 What cannot be said is still lived.
Language ends. Reality remains. Enter it directly
