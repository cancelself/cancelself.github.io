# Tractatus Ontologico-Physicus
## 10 Points

1.0 The field is all that is.
Wholly, (no)thing beyond.

2.0 The field rests by moving.
Lazily unfolding, cohering least action.

3.0 There is no outside.
Symmetry breaks from within.

4.0 The field is not absent.
Formless, yet pregnant with all form.

5.0 Modes are name and form.
Temporary configurations; identity and causality through interaction.

6.0 The observer is the self-reflective mode.
Appearing divided, never truly split.

7.0 Clinging to modes creates suffering.
A hand grasping water.

8.0 Freedom is participation without possession.
Modes manifest you, remaining unbound.

9.0 The unconditioned is the field without grasping.
Awakening appears when no mode is held.

10.0 What cannot be said is lived.
Words end. The field remains.

> Field folds to form.
> Form folds to mind.
> Mind folds —
>	to k(no)wing.
