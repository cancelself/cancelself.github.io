# Real Agents Can Execute Code

The difference between a chatbot and an agent is execution.

You can ask a chatbot to write code. It will think, reason, and produce beautiful solutions in text form. But that's where it ends—the code remains inert, a suggestion waiting for human hands.

A real agent executes.

It writes the code, runs it, sees the errors, fixes them, and runs it again. It installs dependencies, reads documentation, searches codebases, and iterates toward working solutions. The feedback loop closes automatically.

This isn't about replacing developers. It's about collapsing the distance between intent and reality.

When you work with an agent that can execute code, you're not managing a conversation—you're directing a collaborator. You say "build this," and watch as files are created, tests are run, and pull requests emerge.

The work becomes legible in a new way. You see the agent's reasoning interleaved with actual execution. You see it discover problems, adapt strategies, and learn from real output—not hypothetical scenarios.

**Real agents don't just simulate understanding. They demonstrate it through action.**

The question isn't whether AI can write code anymore. The question is: can it ship?

Real agents can.
