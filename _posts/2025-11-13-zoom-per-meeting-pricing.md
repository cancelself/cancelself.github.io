# Zoom's New "Per Zoom" Fee

Zoom is moving to a "per Zoom" pricing model.

This is a fundamental shift from how video conferencing has been priced. Instead of paying for seats or subscription tiers, you'll pay each time you use the service.

It's a return to pre-internet economics: pay per use, like phone calls or taxi rides. Except this is worse—you're paying for something that costs Zoom essentially nothing at the margin.

The cloud was supposed to make things cheaper through scale. Instead, we're watching SaaS companies realize they can extract more value by metering what used to be flat-rate.

Zoom isn't alone here. This is the pattern:

1. Build market share with generous free tiers and flat pricing
2. Become essential infrastructure
3. Start metering usage
4. Extract maximum revenue per interaction

The "per Zoom" fee means every meeting now has a visible cost. Calendar invites become spending decisions. The casual "let's hop on a quick call" gains friction.

This changes behavior. Not necessarily for the better.

We'll see more asynchronous communication, which could be good. We'll also see more reluctance to collaborate, which definitely isn't.

**The subscription model aligned incentives: pay once, use freely, focus on value.** The per-use model misaligns them: every interaction is a transaction.

Zoom built its business on being the easy default. Metered pricing makes it the expensive one.
