# Zoom Wants You to Charge for Your Time

Zoom Scheduler now has built-in payments. You can set a price, collect upfront through Stripe, and manage refunds—all within the scheduling flow.

The pitch is straightforward: monetize your time, reduce no-shows, cut admin overhead. Turn your calendar into a payment gateway.

This isn't Zoom charging you more. It's Zoom enabling you to charge others.

**Every platform eventually discovers payments.** Twitter added tips and subscriptions. LinkedIn wants you to pay for InMail. Discord sells server boosts. The pattern is universal: build the network, then monetize the interactions.

Zoom Scheduler with payments transforms video conferencing infrastructure into transaction infrastructure. The meeting isn't the product anymore—your time is.

This changes the nature of professional relationships. A "quick call" is no longer casual when there's a price attached. Every calendar invite becomes a value proposition. The friction of payment separates signal from noise.

For consultants, coaches, and experts who already charge for their time, this is pure convenience—consolidating Calendly, Stripe, and Zoom into one tool.

For everyone else, it's a quiet nudge: *your time has a price. Why aren't you charging for it?*

The implications are subtle but significant:

- More gatekeeping behind paywalls
- Professional networks stratifying by willingness to pay
- Commodification of expertise that might not scale well
- Reduction in spontaneous, exploratory conversations

Zoom is betting that enough people want to monetize their calendars to make this worth building. They're probably right.

**The question isn't whether you can charge for your time. It's whether you should.**

When platforms make it frictionless to extract value from every interaction, we optimize for transactions over relationships. Some expertise should have a price. Some conversations shouldn't.

The infrastructure doesn't know the difference. It just processes payments.

*The easiest way to monetize something is to make monetization easy.*
