# Zoom Scheduler Adds Payments

[https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0082294 | Zoom Support]: "Now, with built-in payments, you can set prices, get paid upfront, and manage refunds all in one place. Monetize your time: Add payments to any booking page so clients pay when they schedule and collect securely through Stripe."

I am going to start charging companies a "per Zoom" fee.
