# The iPhone Should Be Vision Pro's Keyboard

The Apple Vision Pro has a virtual keyboard problem.

Typing in spatial computing currently means either air-tapping at a floating keyboard—tedious and error-prone—or speaking out loud, which doesn't work in public spaces or for passwords and code.

But there's already a perfect keyboard in your pocket: your iPhone.

## The Obvious Solution

The iPhone is already the best mobile keyboard Apple makes. It's tactile, responsive, and muscle memory for billions of users. Why not use it as Vision Pro's input device?

Apple has all the pieces:
- **Continuity**: AirDrop, Handoff, Universal Control—they've mastered device communication
- **Privacy**: End-to-end encrypted connections between your devices
- **Context awareness**: Your iPhone knows when you're wearing Vision Pro
- **The hardware**: Both devices are already in users' hands

## How It Should Work

You're in Vision Pro, a text field has focus. You pull out your iPhone. The keyboard appears on your phone automatically, in context. You type normally—with real tactile feedback—and the text appears in your spatial environment.

No setup. No app switching. Just seamless input.

This isn't radical—it's the natural extension of what Apple's ecosystem already does. Your iPhone becomes a smart trackpad. A keyboard. A precision input device for spatial computing.

## Why It Matters

Input methods define the usability of computing platforms. The mouse made graphical interfaces possible. Touchscreens made mobile computing natural. Vision Pro needs its input moment.

Right now, the Vision Pro assumes you'll adapt to spatial input. But the best technology adapts to users, not the other way around.

The iPhone keyboard solution respects how people actually work: they want speed, accuracy, and privacy. They want to use tools they already know.

## The Real Innovation

Making this seamless would be the innovation—not inventing new gestures or teaching users to type in thin air.

Let spatial computing be spatial. Let the iPhone be what it's best at: a refined input device with years of optimization.

Your phone knows how you type. It predicts your words. It corrects your mistakes. Why throw that away when you put on a headset?
